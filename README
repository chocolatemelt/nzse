initial setup with poetry:

1. install poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

2. install deps

run stuff with poetry shell, which creates a virtualenv for you and keeps things nice and tidy
$ poetry shell

vscode shenanigans:

$ code .

to open this project in VSCode, which should give you first-class terminal support, linting, and auto-formatting

make sure you select flake8 for your linter and black for your auto-formatter.
and if it wasn't clear already, your interpreter should be the one from your virtualenv.
